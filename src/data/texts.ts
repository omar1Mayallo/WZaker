The name of the father of the Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) was ‘Abdullah and His mother Aaminah. His father died before He was born while His mother was still carrying Him in her womb. The Prophet (ﷺ) was yet only six years old when His mother too died.

We have seen the individual and collective aspects of the pure life of the Khatim Al-Anbiya Muhammad (ﷺ). On the one hand, He preferred solitude to immerse himself in the knowledge of Allah, to search the straight path and to concentrate on reforming fellow-men. On the other hand, He spoke the truth with individuals and tribes, truthfulness was His habit and His dealings with other people were very fair. His excellent character endeared Him to all people who were unanimous in calling Him As-Sadiq and Al-Ameen (the truthful, the trustworthy).

The first verses that were revealed to the beloved Prophet (ﷺ) were from Surah Al-Alaq.

Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) was sent to all mankind. The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) enlightened his people through the Quran on the concept of unity of Allah. He explained the Oneness of the deity and invited all mankind to believe in it.`;

It was memorized by Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) and then dictated to the Companions of Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ), and written down by scribes, who cross-checked it during his lifetime.
Allah Himself has taken the responsibility of protecting the Quran, And the Qur'an is still safe today as it was revealed. Not one word of Quran’s 114 chapters and Surahs has been changed over the centuries, so that the Quran is in every detail the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) fourteen centuries ago.
The life of our Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) was moulded according to the Quran and He gave a practical demonstration of whatever the Quran said.`;
