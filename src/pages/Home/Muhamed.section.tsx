      par1="Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) born in Makkah, It was the 9th Rabi’ Ul-Awwal corresponding to 20th April 571. That morning was an auspicious morning for a town, unblessed with civic amenities, devoid of greenery and uncultivable. It was one of its honoured tribes, the Banu Hashim, favoured with a Blessing. Aaminah bint Wahib the wife of ‘Abdullah bin ‘Abdul Muttalib gave birth to the light of Messengers, Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ)."
      par2="By Allah! What a propitious morning that was which proclaimed to the wide world the rising of guidance! What a favourable moment when the good news of the Prophet’s arrival was heard from every particle on earth and in the universe. It was as if every little thing was singing that the time of difficulty was gone, and the darkness of polytheism and infidelity was taken over by this light of guidance. Idolatry was banished and worship of One Allah was the objective of life."
      par3={`There is a Marfoo Hadith [Marfoo Hadith is one which is traced direct to the Prophet] in Bukhari in which the Prophet (ﷺ) says, “I am Muhammad, I am Ahmad, I am Mahee -- one who removes disbelief and polytheism -- I am Hashir because on the day of Resurrection, I will be the first to present myself before Allah, and I am ‘Aaqib”.

      The name of the father of the Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) was ‘Abdullah and His mother Aaminah. His father died before He was born while His mother was still carrying Him in her womb. The Prophet (ﷺ) was yet only six years old when His mother too died.
      
      We have seen the individual and collective aspects of the pure life of the Khatim Al-Anbiya Muhammad (ﷺ). On the one hand, He preferred solitude to immerse himself in the knowledge of Allah, to search the straight path and to concentrate on reforming fellow-men. On the other hand, He spoke the truth with individuals and tribes, truthfulness was His habit and His dealings with other people were very fair. His excellent character endeared Him to all people who were unanimous in calling Him As-Sadiq and Al-Ameen (the truthful, the trustworthy).
      
      The first verses that were revealed to the beloved Prophet (ﷺ) were from Surah Al-Alaq.
      
      Hazrat Muhammad (ﷺ) was sent to all mankind. The Holy Prophet (ﷺ) enlightened his people through the Quran on the concept of unity of Allah. He explained the Oneness of the deity and invited all mankind to believe in it.
